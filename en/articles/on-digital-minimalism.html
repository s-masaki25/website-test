        <h1>On Digital Minimalism</h1>

        <p class="lead">Our devices promise connection and productivity, yet often deliver distraction and anxiety. Digital minimalism offers a path back to intentional living.</p>

        <p>We carry supercomputers in our pockets. We have instant access to the sum of human knowledge. We can communicate with anyone, anywhere, at any time. And yet, we feel more scattered, more overwhelmed, more disconnected than ever before.</p>

        <h2>The Attention Economy</h2>

        <p>The apps on our phones are not neutral tools. They are designed—meticulously, deliberately—to capture and hold our attention. Every notification, every infinite scroll, every red badge is engineered to trigger a response. We are not the customers; we are the product.</p>

        <p>This is not a conspiracy theory. It is a business model. And understanding it is the first step toward reclaiming our autonomy.</p>

        <h2>The Cost of Constant Connectivity</h2>

        <p>What do we lose when our attention is fragmented across dozens of apps and hundreds of notifications? We lose the ability to think deeply. We lose presence with the people we love. We lose the quiet moments where creativity and insight emerge.</p>

        <p>Cal Newport, who popularized the term "digital minimalism," describes it as "a philosophy of technology use in which you focus your online time on a small number of carefully selected activities that strongly support things you value."</p>

        <h2>Principles of Digital Minimalism</h2>

        <p>Digital minimalism is not about rejecting technology. It is about being intentional with it. Here are some guiding principles:</p>

        <p><strong>Clutter is costly.</strong> Every app, every account, every subscription has a cost—not just in money, but in attention and mental overhead. Regularly audit your digital life and remove what no longer serves you.</p>

        <p><strong>Optimization is important.</strong> For the tools you do choose to use, spend time configuring them to serve you better. Disable notifications. Use website blockers. Create friction for the behaviors you want to reduce.</p>

        <p><strong>Intentionality is satisfying.</strong> There is deep satisfaction in using technology purposefully rather than reactively. Check email at scheduled times. Use your phone as a tool, not a pacifier.</p>

        <h2>Starting Small</h2>

        <p>You don't need to delete all your accounts or throw your phone in a lake. Start with small experiments. Try a weekend without social media. Leave your phone in another room while you work. Notice how it feels.</p>

        <p>The goal is not deprivation but liberation. When we free ourselves from the compulsive pull of our devices, we create space for what matters: deep work, genuine connection, solitude, and rest.</p>

        <h2>A Personal Practice</h2>

        <p>Digital minimalism is not a set of rules to follow. It is a practice to develop. What works for one person may not work for another. The key is to keep asking: Is this technology serving my values? Is it helping me live the life I want?</p>

        <p>In an age of constant connectivity, choosing disconnection is a radical act. It is a declaration that our attention is valuable, that our time is finite, and that we get to decide how we spend it.</p>
