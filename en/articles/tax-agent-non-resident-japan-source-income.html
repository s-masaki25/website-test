        <h1>Tax Agent for Non-Residents in Japan</h1>

        <p class="lead">For non-residents holding Japan-source income, various obligations—including tax filings, payments, or refund claims—may arise despite their overseas status. Establishing a Tax Agent provides a dedicated domestic point of contact, ensuring seamless compliance and effective communication with the Japanese tax authorities.</p>

        <h2>Tax Compliance Obligations for Non-Residents</h2>

        <p>Non-residents may be required to file tax returns, remit payments, or claim refunds in Japan in connection with Japan-source income. Typical scenarios include, but are not limited to, receiving rental income from Japanese real estate, realizing capital gains from the sale of domestic property, or earning salary income that is subject to Japanese taxation due to the nature of the work arrangement. In such instances, appointing a Tax Agent facilitates the efficient management of administrative communications and legal procedures while the taxpayer remains abroad.</p>

        <h2>Scope and Jurisdiction of a Tax Agent</h2>

        <p>Upon the formal appointment and notification of a Tax Agent, official correspondence from the tax authorities is generally directed to the designated agent. It is important to note, however, that the appropriate venue for filing tax returns is determined by the tax office holding jurisdiction over the non-resident's tax domicile in Japan; it does not automatically shift to the jurisdiction where the Tax Agent's office is situated.</p>

        <h2>Selection of a Tax Agent</h2>

        <p>A Tax Agent is typically an individual appointed to manage a broad range of ongoing administrative responsibilities. These include the receipt of official correspondence, the submission of tax filings, the execution of tax payments, and the processing of refund claims. Consequently, it is prudent to select an agent based on their reliability in communication, rigorous deadline management, and overall operational capacity.</p>

        <h2>Notification Procedures and Jurisdictional Requirements</h2>

        <p>When tax filings or related administrative actions are anticipated, the taxpayer must appoint a Tax Agent and submit the prescribed notification (the "Report on the Designation of a Tax Agent") to the tax office holding jurisdiction over their tax domicile. Should the appointment no longer be necessary—for instance, if the individual returns to Japan and resumes residency—a notification of dismissal must also be filed to formalize the conclusion of the agent's mandate.</p>

        <h2>Operational Workflow and Filing Methods</h2>

        <p>Notifications are typically submitted in hard copy, although certain procedures may be facilitated through Japan's electronic filing system (e-Tax), depending on the specific nature of the filing. A standard operational sequence is as follows: (i) identify a suitable Tax Agent, (ii) submit the formal notification to the relevant tax office, and (iii) authorize the agent to manage ongoing correspondence and tax obligations—including filings, payments, and refund claims—from within Japan.</p>

        <h2>Replacement and Dismissal of a Tax Agent</h2>

        <p>When replacing a current Tax Agent with a new appointee, the standard procedure requires formalizing the dismissal of the incumbent agent, followed by the submission of a new appointment notification. Given that individual circumstances—such as changes in overseas residency or revised filing requirements—often evolve, it is prudent to periodically review these arrangements. Should a Tax Agent no longer be required, a formal dismissal notification must be filed to ensure the proper conclusion of the agent's mandate.</p>

        <h2>Special Considerations for Foreign Residents Departing Japan</h2>

        <p>When a foreign national residing in Japan departs the country—thereby becoming a non-resident for Japanese tax purposes—certain "Exit Tax" provisions may apply. These regulations target unrealized gains on "covered assets" (including global holdings) with an aggregate value of JPY 100 million or more, subject to specific conditions. In such cases, the presence of a Tax Agent significantly influences the procedural timeline, such as determining whether filings must be completed by the time of departure or by the standard annual deadline. Furthermore, eligibility for the tax deferral regime often necessitates the formal appointment of a Tax Agent prior to departure.</p>
